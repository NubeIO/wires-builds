A universally unique identifier (UUID) is an identifier standard used in software construction. A UUID is simply a 128-bit value. The meaning of each bit is defined by any of several variants. For human-readable display, many systems use a canonical format using hexadecimal text with inserted hyphen characters. For example : de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014\" },\n    },\n    'dashboard': {\n        'button': { title: 'Button', description: \"Dashboard node which displays a push button on the dashboard.
